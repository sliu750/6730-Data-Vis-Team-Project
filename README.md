Topic: Environmental Impacts of Agriculture

# Overview

As the global population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, creating environmental challenges. Many agricultural practices contribute to environmental degradation. For example, cattle farming and the use of agricultural chemicals release greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, worsening air pollution. Overgrazing weakens soil quality and reduces biodiversity, leaving ecosystems vulnerable to disruptions. Additionally, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides contaminates water sources, jeopardizing human and animal health. To better understand how agriculture has impacted the environment, we'll visualize greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water quality degradation.

# Current Status of Agriculture

A few countries are clearly dominant in terms of agricultural land use, such as China, United States, Australia. Within a continent, a couple of countries are the main agricultural producers- for example Brazil and Argentina in South America. This is no surprise given their land areas and in some cases, their populations.

But what about agricultural energy consumption? Surely modern farming technology requires energy, whether in the form of electricity or fossil fuels.

Pesticide use has displayed some interesting trends over the years.

With this in mind, let's first look at greenhouse gas emissions.

And now how is biodiversity affected?

What about water quality?

But at the end of day, are the environmental losses justifiable? What have we gained?
