Topic: Environmental Impacts of Agriculture

# Overview

As the global population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, creating environmental challenges. Many agricultural practices contribute to environmental degradation. For example, cattle farming and the use of agricultural chemicals release greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, worsening air pollution. Overgrazing weakens soil quality and reduces biodiversity, leaving ecosystems vulnerable to disruptions. Additionally, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides contaminates water sources, jeopardizing human and animal health. To better understand how agriculture has impacted the environment, we'll visualize greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water quality degradation.

# Current Status of Agriculture

A few countries are clearly dominant in terms of agricultural land use, such as China, United States, and Australia. Within a continent, a couple of countries are the main agricultural producers- for example Brazil and Argentina in South America. This is no surprise given their land areas and in some cases, their populations.

But what about agricultural energy consumption? Surely modern farming technology requires energy, whether in the form of electricity or fossil fuels. Here is how worldwide agricultural energy use has changed from 2012 to 2021.

Pesticide use has displayed some interesting trends over the years. Click on a continent to focus on trends within that coontinent.

Another important aspect of agriculture is meat production. Here you can see changes in the types of meat production over the years, and the countries that are primarily producing those meats.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

With this in mind, let's first look at greenhouse gas emissions.

# Water Quality

What about water quality?

Here you can see how worldwide water use has changed over the years.

But at the end of day, are the environmental losses justifiable? What have we gained? Here you can see how total factor productivity (TFP) has changed over the last 6 decades for regions around the world. Asia, South Europe, and South America (particularly Brazil) have made the largest improvements.
